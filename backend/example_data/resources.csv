103,COPASI Platform,Virginia Tech,Info/Analytics,,Chris Barrett,,,,,"COPASI (Complex Pathway Simulator) is a major software package that allows users to model, simulate and analyze biochemical and systems biology networks. Models in COPASI are based on reactions that convert a set of species into another set of species. Each species is located in a compartment, which is a physical location with a size (volume, area, etc). This maps directly to biochemical reaction networks, but can also represent other types of processes (for example, the species could be cell types). COPASI automatically converts the reaction network to a set of differential equations or to a system of stochastic reaction events — the user does not have to write down the math explicitly, the software does that. Simulation can be performed either with stochastic kinetics or with differential equations, and the software easily allows switching between them. The software provides an interface to create parameter scans (sweeps), parameter sampling and repeated simulations — including complex simulation scenarios mixing parameter samples with scans and repeats of simulations (or other analyses). Simulations can be of time courses or steady states and algorithms include (LSODAR, Gillespie’s method, Birbson & Brooke’s method, τ-leap, Adaptive SSA/τ-leap, Hybrid Runge-Kutta/SSA, and Hybrid LSODA/SSA. Models can be analyzed and modified with a large set of methods including mass conservation analysis and elementary flux modes, optimization of arbitrary components, parameter estimation, local sensitivity analysis, time scale separation, stochasticity analysis using linear noise approximation, cross sections, and Lyapunov exponents for chaos analysis. Data can be visualized using network diagrams, arbitrary 2D plots (including trajectories in phase space), color-coded matrices, and 3D bar charts. COPASI allows users to define report files where data is written to during simulations and analyses. These report files are useful for importing data onto other applications for further analysis and visualization. ",,

Contagions may be spread, for example, by face-to-face interaction and/or electronic means (e.g., social media). Simulation is an effective way to study these dynamics of contagion spread. Often simulations are carried out on populations that are represented as networks, where vertices represent agents (e.g., people) and edges represent their interactions. Typically, populations are composed of thousands, millions, or even billions of agents, with the result that only a small fraction of the possible dynamics can be evaluated. Understanding of system dynamics, provides insights on how to control them. Examples include: How to minimize the spread of epidemics. How to increase the probability that a marketing campaign goes viral. How to spread safety tips among drug users. How to encourage healthy youth behavior (e.g., avoid smoking, excessive drinking). Populations of (human) agents and their interactions are modeled in this system. Translation from reality to model: Graph of nodes, each has a state. Vertex Functions quantifies when a node changes state, and to what state, based on its neighborhood. Update Scheme defines the ordering of execution the functions. Update Scheme can be sequential: Nodes update one-at-a-time in a prescribed order. Synchronous: Nodes update simultaneously. Block sequential:  generalizes the other two. A primary use:  compute phase space. Set of all state transitions for all possible system states. The Graph Dynamical Systems Calculator (GDSCalc) is a web-based application within the CINET suite. Unlike most simulators, GDSCalc computes all of the dynamics for a given system, which are represented as a phase space. Consequently, it operates on much smaller networks. GDSCalc provides a user interface to select or create networks, assign models to vertices that describe their behavior, and specify the order in which the dynamics are processed; it also manages data and jobs across users. A computational engine performs the calculations on a cluster, and results are displayed textually and graphically. One of the primary uses of GDSCalc is experimental mathematics, where computed behaviors for smaller networks provide direction for theoretical characterizations of systems in general, even systems with billions of agents.",,

137,ITMI Data and Analytics Resources,Inova,Info/Analytics,,,,,,,"The leadership at ITMI appreciates the many advances made in electronic data capture and integrated data management systems and therefore is not attempting to grow their own Information Management Systems (IMS) from scratch. We have assembled a variety of industry standard systems, outlined below and are employing a known system, built by Digital Infuzion, and leveraged by the FDA for the integration of data. Starting with sample acquisition, all biospecimen information associated with studies, participants, and events is handled in a structured Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS).  ITMI translational medicine informatics environment will eventually integrate all Electronic Data Capture (EDC) information, LIMS data, and molecular data, within a single, standards driven environment. While the integrated environment is not fully built at this stage, we anticipate establishing a fully integrated environment to include a data feed from the Inova EHR (Epic). The leadership at ITMI has spent six years working on large-scale genome characterization activities, collaborating with the world’s leaders in genome sequencing, data management and algorithm development. With that context, ITMI has spent more than two years evaluating and testing the information management and computing solutions to support collaborative WGS projects. From our experience, the computing infrastructure must meet the following requirements: (a) cost-effective storage, that scales from gigabytes to hundreds of petabytes, (b) reliable, long term storage, providing 99.999999999% durability, (c) the ability to associate high IO and high performance compute capacity with data, to support the necessary computing requirements and reduce network bandwidth requirements, (d) role-based data access, (e) the ability to encrypt data at rest and in motion in order to meet Federal Information Processing Standards, (f) a secure computing environment outside institutional firewalls and accessible to collaborators, and (g) low administration overhead. The ITMI utilizes Amazon Web Services (AWS) to meet all of these requirements. Since our sequencing contractor makes its customer data available via the AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) storage solution, data transfer to the ITMI S3 bucket is fast, easy and secure - no shipping of disks through the mail or time intensive and expensive data downloads. The security is stringent enough to earn AWS a FISMA Moderate Certification, allowing us to easily meet HIPAA requirements. Within this basic framework, we are able to set up development and production environments, various data access scenarios, and virtual private clouds for increased protection for different workflows. Additionally, all allowed collaborators can access the data from anywhere in the world, based on user certificates. With the AWS Service Level Agreements, ITMI is guaranteed a high level of system availability and system integrity – significantly reducing our overall responsibility and cost.",,

317,Institutional Review Board,Virginia Tech,Regulatory and Compliance,,Dr. Gary Sherman,,,,,"The Office of the Virginia Tech Vice President for Research is responsible for the administration and oversight of research compliance at VT. It oversees the functioning of the IRB, which is within the Office of Research Compliance (ORC). The ORC is under the direction of Associate Vice President for Research Compliance. It is the researcher's responsibility to seek and obtain prior VT IRB approval as deemed appropriate using the Activities Requiring Virginia Tech IRB Approval flowchart. Projects requiring VT IRB review according to the flowchart require approval regardless of the location of the research activity (i.e., conducted on or off campus), source of funding (i.e., federally funded, privately funded or non-funded), and whether the research is exempt under the Code of Federal Regulations for Protection of Human Subjects (45 CFR 46). The VT IRB may cede authority to a collaborating institution's IRB, if both institutions agree to do so. VT does not conduct or provide oversight over human subject research for which investigational devices or drugs are used. The VT IRB will typically not consider review requests from agencies and organizations outside the University for research that does not involve VT faculty or that is not sponsored by VT. Review agreements exist between VT and Carilion Medical Center. VT has one IRB responsible for conducting initial and continuing reviews, and providing oversight for all human subject research activities involving VT researchers or for which VT is engaged. Review procedures are conducted in accordance with Virginia Tech's Federalwide Assurance Terms. Any time the IRB or staff determine they do not have the necessary scholarly or scientific expertise for sound review, they may request ad hoc consultants. Consultants are independent of the IRB and are selected according to scholarly and scientific expertise. Consultants may be called upon to judge the scientific soundness of a research protocol, make a fair and accurate determination of the risk-benefit ratio, review the cultural appropriateness of the informed consent process, and offer additional and unique expert advice. However, consultants cannot make any review determinations; they may only provide counsel. Individuals providing consultation to the IRB agree to and sign a confidentiality agreement prior to the receipt and review of submission documents, unless the principal investigator waives his/her right to confidentiality. All activities involving human subjects in research, regardless of funding source, must be reviewed by the Virginia Tech IRB before recruiting, enrolling, or involving subjects in that research. Virginia Tech, in following established federal regulations, utilizes three classes of review of human subject research: exempt review, expedited review and full board review. At Carilion Clinic, before research can be conducted by Carilion employees or at Carilion facilities, it must first be reviewed by the Research and Development (R&D) office and then approved by the IRB. Carilion Clinic has established two IRB committees composed of members from a variety of medical and scientific backgrounds, including community members. Carilion Clinic IRB members are appointed by the vice president for Academic Affairs. The work of the IRB Committees is supported and administered by the department of the Institutional Review Board. The Carilion Clinic IRB reviews the research protocol, the informed consent document that is signed by subjects, any advertising used to recruit subjects and other relevant documents. In order to be approved by the IRB, a research study must: provide research subjects with complete information in simple, understandable terms so that they can give informed consent, protect the physical, psychological and economic well-being of subjects, be fair and impartial in selecting and dealing with research subjects and respect the rights of research subjects and protect the confidentiality of information about them. The primary positions at the Carilion IRB are the IRB Chair, the IRB Vice-Chair, the Human Protections Administrator, the Regulatory Affairs Administrator, and the IRB Administrator. The Carilion Clinic IRB Chair is appointed by the institutional official and meets specific qualifications as mandated in IRB Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Responsibilities of the Chair include: to remain current and be familiar with state and federal regulations pertaining to IRBs and human subjects research and Carilion Clinic IRB SOPs and SOGs, to ensure that projects submitted for review are in compliance with 45 CFR 46, 21 CFR 50 and 21 CFR 56 and the terms of Carilion Clinic’s assurance with OHRP, to conduct expedited reviews and designate reviewers who can conduct expedited reviews, to evaluate continuing review applications, protocol and consent form changes, adverse event reports and study closing notifications and make recommendations to the full board or approve under expedited review, to convene and oversee the conduct of IRB meetings, to review and approve minutes of IRB meetings, to issue formal decisions on review applications, to assess conflicts of interest reported by IRB members, to address serious and continuing non-compliance problems, to be a resource for investigators and IRB members regarding human subjects research, to attend training and education sessions as required, o be a voting member of the IRB, to delegate or appoint designees to conduct any of the above duties as necessary. The Carilion Clinic IRB Vice-chair, in the absence of the IRB Chair, in the case of a Chair’s potential conflict of interest, or at the discretion of the Chair, shall fulfill any or all of the Chair’s duties. Responsibilities of the IRB Vice-chair include: to remain current and be familiar with state and federal regulations pertaining to IRBs and Carilion Clinic IRB SOPs and SOGs, to ensure that projects submitted for review are in compliance with 45 CFR 46, 21 CFR 50 and 21 CFR 56 and the terms of Carilion Clinic’s Assurance with OHRP, to be a resource for investigators and IRB members regarding human subjects research, to attend training and education sessions as required, and to be a voting member of the IRB. The Carilion Clinic IRB also has a Human Protections Administrator (HPA) who serves as the primary institutional contact person and has administrative responsibility for the Human Protections Program, an IRB Regulatory Affairs Administrator (RAA) who is responsible for the regulatory compliance of all research that has been reviewed by the Carilion IRB, and an IRB Administrator who is the primary liaison between the IRB and the principal investigators.",,

Collaborative Research Grants are intended to improve research competitiveness within the Commonwealth by providing funding for faculty teams to engage in pilot research which could be used as a springboard for subsequent external funding (e.g., federal or foundation grants). Proposals involving only one faculty member will not be considered; collaboration with researchers at another university, research institution, or campus location in Virginia is strongly encouraged, but not required. It is anticipated that a total of $250,000 will be awarded with a maximum request of $30,000 per proposal. Funding can be requested for up to two years.
